A Weather App Using React Vite that has a color change based on the mood of the weather. Type in any city in the world and see the current temperature and the 5 day forecast. Feature of adding favorite cities. 

Earlier versions of this repository included a hardcoded API key that has since been revoked and completely removed from the commit history using BFG Repo-Cleaner. The application now loads API keys securely from environment variables using a .env file (which is excluded from version control via .gitignore).
